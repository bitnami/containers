  # Load the entrypoint to unset an environment variable not supported by Java 1.8
  # Java 1.8 does not support --version, with -version printing to stderr
  # We need to parse the printed version differently depending on the version:
  # - Major versions are often shown as "x" instead of "x.0.0"
  # - In Java 1.8, the printed version is 1.8.0_x, but $APP_VERSION is formated as 1.8.x
  # - Versions are usually printed as x.y.z+b, but $APP_VERSION is formated as x.y.z-r
  # - In Java 1.8, the version may also be printed as x.y.z-b0r or x.y.z-br
