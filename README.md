# The Bitnami Containers Library

Popular applications, provided by [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com), containerized and ready to launch.

## ⚠️ Important Notice: Upcoming changes to the Bitnami Catalog

Beginning August 28th, 2025, Bitnami will evolve its public catalog to offer a curated set of hardened, security-focused images under the new [Bitnami Secure Images initiative](https://news.broadcom.com/app-dev/broadcom-introduces-bitnami-secure-images-for-production-ready-containerized-applications). As part of this transition:

- Granting community users access for the first time to security-optimized versions of popular container images.
- Bitnami will begin deprecating support for non-hardened, Debian-based software images in its free tier and will gradually remove non-latest tags from the public catalog. As a result, community users will have access to a reduced number of hardened images. These images are published only under the “latest” tag and are intended for development purposes
- Starting August 28th, over two weeks, all existing container images, including older or versioned tags (e.g., 2.50.0, 10.6), will be migrated from the public catalog (docker.io/bitnami) to the “Bitnami Legacy” repository (docker.io/bitnamilegacy), where they will no longer receive updates.
- For production workloads and long-term support, users are encouraged to adopt Bitnami Secure Images, which include hardened containers, smaller attack surfaces, CVE transparency (via VEX/KEV), SBOMs, and enterprise support.

These changes aim to improve the security posture of all Bitnami users by promoting best practices for software supply chain integrity and up-to-date deployments. For more details, visit the [Bitnami Secure Images announcement](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/issues/83267).

## Why use Bitnami Images?

- Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
- With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
- Bitnami containers, virtual machines, and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
- All our images are based on [**minideb**](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) -a minimalist Debian-based container image that gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution- or **scratch** -an explicitly empty image-.
- All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Notation](https://notaryproject.dev/). [Check this post](https://blog.bitnami.com/2024/03/bitnami-packaged-containers-and-helm.html) to know how to verify the integrity of the images.
- Bitnami container images are released regularly with the latest distribution packages available.

Looking to use our applications in production? Try [VMware Tanzu Application Catalog](https://bitnami.com/enterprise), the enterprise edition of Bitnami Application Catalog.

## Get an image

The recommended way to get any of the Bitnami Images is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/).

```console
docker pull bitnami/APP
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag.

```console
docker pull bitnami/APP:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile, and executing the `docker build` command.

```console
git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
docker build -t bitnami/APP .
```

> [!TIP]
> Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION`, and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` placeholders in the example command above with the correct values.

## Run the application using Docker Compose

The main folder of each application contains a functional `docker-compose.yml` file. Run the application using it as shown below:

```console
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/containers/main/bitnami/APP/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

> [!TIP]
> Remember to replace the `APP` placeholder in the example command above with the correct value.

## Vulnerability scan in Bitnami container images

As part of the release process, the Bitnami container images are analyzed for vulnerabilities. At this moment, we are using two different tools:

- [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)
- [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)

This scanning process is triggered via a GH action for every PR affecting the source code of the containers, regardless of its nature or origin.

## Retention policy

Deprecated assets will be retained in the container registry ([Bitnami DockerHub org](https://hub.docker.com/u/bitnami)) without changes for, at least, 6 months after the deprecation.
After that period, all the images will be moved to a new _"archived"_ repository. For instance, once deprecated an asset named _foo_ whose container repository was `bitnami/foo`, all the images will be moved to `bitnami/foo-archived` where they will remain indefinitely.

Special images, like `bitnami/bitnami-shell` or `bitnami/sealed-secrets`, which are extensively used in Helm charts, will have an extended coexistence period of 1 year.

## Contributing

We'd love for you to contribute to those container images. You can request new features by creating an [issue](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/issues/new/choose), or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/pulls) with your contribution.
