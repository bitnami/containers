## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [**minideb**](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) -a minimalist Debian based container image that gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution- or **scratch** -an explicitly empty image-.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Notation](https://notaryproject.dev/). [Check this post](https://blog.bitnami.com/2024/03/bitnami-packaged-containers-and-helm.html) to know how to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-work-with-non-root-containers-index.html).

## Only latest stable branch maintained in the free Bitnami catalog

Starting December 10th 2024, only the latest stable branch of any container will receive updates in the free Bitnami catalog. To access up-to-date releases for all upstream-supported branches, consider upgrading to Bitnami Premium. Previous versions already released will not be deleted. They are still available to pull from DockerHub.

Please check the Bitnami Premium page in our partner [Arrow Electronics](https://www.arrow.com/globalecs/na/vendors/bitnami?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=containers) for more information.

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html).

You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`.

Subscribe to project updates by watching the [bitnami/containers GitHub repo](https://github.com/bitnami/containers).

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami OpenResty Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/openresty).

```console
docker pull bitnami/openresty:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the
[list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/openresty/tags/)
in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
docker pull bitnami/openresty:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command. Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION` and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` path placeholders in the example command below with the correct values.

```console
git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
docker build -t bitnami/APP:latest .
```

## Hosting a static website

This OpenResty image exposes a volume at `/app`. Content mounted here is served by the default catch-all server block.

```console
docker run -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/openresty:latest
```

## Accessing your server from the host

To access your web server from your host machine you can ask Docker to map a random port on your host to ports `8080` and `8443` exposed in the container.

```console
docker run --name nginx -P bitnami/openresty:latest
```

Run `docker port` to determine the random ports Docker assigned.

```console
$ docker port openresty
8080/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32769
```

You can also manually specify the ports you want forwarded from your host to the container.

```console
docker run -p 9000:8080 bitnami/openresty:latest
```

Access your web server in the browser by navigating to `http://localhost:9000`.

### Initializing a new instance

When the container is executed for the first time, it will execute the files with extensions `.sh` located at `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`.

In order to have your custom files inside the docker image you can mount them as a volume.

### Adding custom server blocks

The default `nginx.conf` includes server blocks placed in `/opt/bitnami/openresty/nginx/conf/server_blocks/`. You can mount a `my_server_block.conf` file containing your custom server block at this location.

For example, in order add a server block for `www.example.com`:

#### Step 1: Write your `my_server_block.conf` file with the following content

```nginx
server {
  listen 0.0.0.0:8080;
  server_name www.example.com;
  root /app;
  index index.htm index.html;
}
```

#### Step 2: Mount the configuration as a volume

```console
docker run --name openresty \
  -v /path/to/my_server_block.conf:/opt/bitnami/openresty/nginx/conf/server_blocks/my_server_block.conf:ro \
  bitnami/openresty:latest
```

### Using custom SSL certificates

*NOTE:* The steps below assume that you are using a custom domain name and that you have already configured the custom domain name to point to your server.

#### Step 1: Prepare your certificate files

In your local computer, create a folder called `certs` and put your certificates files. Make sure you rename both files to `server.crt` and `server.key` respectively:

```console
mkdir -p /path/to/openresty-persistence/certs
cp /path/to/certfile.crt /path/to/openresty-persistence/certs/server.crt
cp /path/to/keyfile.key  /path/to/openresty-persistence/certs/server.key
```

#### Step 2: Provide a custom Server Block for SSL connections

Write your `my_server_block.conf` file with the SSL configuration and the relative path to the certificates:

```nginx
  server {
    listen       8443 ssl;

    ssl_certificate      bitnami/certs/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key  bitnami/certs/server.key;

    ssl_session_cache    shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  5m;

    ssl_ciphers  HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers  on;

    location / {
      root   html;
      index  index.html index.htm;
    }
  }
```

#### Step 3: Run the OpenResty image and open the SSL port

Run the OpenResty image, mounting the certificates directory from your host.

```console
docker run --name openresty \
  -v /path/to/my_server_block.conf:/opt/bitnami/openresty/nginx/conf/server_blocks/my_server_block.conf:ro \
  -v /path/to/openresty-persistence/certs:/certs \
  bitnami/openresty:latest
```

### Full configuration

The image looks for configurations in `/opt/bitnami/openresty/nginx/conf/nginx.conf`. You can overwrite the `nginx.conf` file using your own custom configuration file.

```console
docker run --name openresty \
  -v /path/to/your_nginx.conf:/opt/bitnami/openresty/nginx/conf/nginx.conf:ro \
  bitnami/openresty:latest
```

### Adding lua modules

Openresty uses its own Lua's package manager named `opm`. It is advised to use `opm` [instead of other Lua's package manager like `luarocks`](https://openresty.org/en/using-luarocks.html). You can easily run the `opm` command from the container command-line, or build your custom image by extending Bitnami's:

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/openresty:latest
RUN opm get openresty/lua-resty-lock
```

Additionally, you can install your custom Lua modules using [your custom init scripts](#initializing-a-new-instance).

## Reverse proxy to other containers

OpenResty can be used to reverse proxy to other containers using Docker's linking system. This is particularly useful if you want to serve dynamic content through an OpenResty frontend. To do so, [add a server block](#adding-custom-server-blocks) like the following in the `/opt/bitnami/openresty/nginx/conf/server_blocks/` folder:

```nginx
server {
    listen 0.0.0.0:8080;
    server_name yourapp.com;
    access_log /opt/bitnami/openresty/nginx/logs/yourapp_access.log;
    error_log /opt/bitnami/openresty/nginx/logs/yourapp_error.log;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header HOST $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

        proxy_pass http://[your_container_alias]:[your_container_port];
        proxy_redirect off;
    }
}
```

## Logging

The Bitnami OpenResty Docker image sends the container logs to the `stdout`. To view the logs:

```console
docker logs openresty
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

## Customize this image

The Bitnami OpenResty Docker image is designed to be extended so it can be used as the base image for your custom web applications.

### Extend this image

Before extending this image, please note there are certain configuration settings you can modify using the original image:

* Settings that can be adapted using environment variables. For instance, you can change the port used by OpenResty for HTTP setting the environment variable `OPENRESTY_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER`.
* [Initializing a new instance](#initializing-a-new-instance)
* [Adding custom server blocks](#adding-custom-server-blocks).
* [Replacing the 'nginx.conf' file](#full-configuration).
* [Using custom SSL certificates](#using-custom-ssl-certificates).

If your desired customizations cannot be covered using the methods mentioned above, extend the image. To do so, create your own image using a Dockerfile with the format below:

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/openresty
## Put your customizations below
...
```

Here is an example of extending the image with the following modifications:

* Install the `vim` editor
* Modify the OpenResty configuration file
* Modify the ports used by OpenResty
* Change the user that runs the container

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/openresty

## Change user to perform privileged actions
USER 0
## Install 'vim'
RUN install_packages vim
## Revert to the original non-root user
USER 1001

## Modify 'worker_connections' on OpenResty config file to '512'
RUN sed -i -r "s#(\s+worker_connections\s+)[0-9]+;#\1512;#" /opt/bitnami/openresty/nginx/conf/nginx.conf

## Modify the ports used by OpenResty by default
ENV OPENRESTY_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER=8181 # It is also possible to change this environment variable at runtime
EXPOSE 8181 8143

## Modify the default container user
USER 1002
```
