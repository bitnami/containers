# Bitnami Secure Image for Kaniko minimal

## What is Kaniko minimal?

> Kaniko builds and pushes container images directly in userspace, allowing secure images in environments like a standard Kubernetes cluster. This ultra-lightweight option is ideal for security-focused and resource-constrained environments.

This container image is only available under the [Bitnami Secure Images initiative](https://news.broadcom.com/app-dev/broadcom-introduces-bitnami-secure-images-for-production-ready-containerized-applications).
