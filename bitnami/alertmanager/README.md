# Bitnami Secure Image for AlertManager

> The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integrations.

## TL;DR

```console
docker run --name alertmanager bitnami/alertmanager:latest
```

## Why use Bitnami Secure Images?

Those are hardened, minimal CVE images built and maintained by Bitnami. Bitnami Secure Images are based on the cloud-optimized, security-hardened enterprise [OS Photon Linux](https://vmware.github.io/photon/). Why choose BSI images?

- Hardened secure images of popular open source software with Near-Zero Vulnerabilities
- Vulnerability Triage & Prioritization with VEX Statements, KEV and EPSS Scores
- Compliance focus with FIPS, STIG, and air-gap options, including secure bill of materials (SBOM)
- Software supply chain provenance attestation through in-toto
- First class support for the internet’s favorite Helm charts

Each image comes with valuable security metadata. You can view the metadata in [our public catalog here](https://app-catalog.vmware.com/bitnami/apps). Note: Some data is only available with [commercial subscriptions to BSI](https://bitnami.com/).

## Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-work-with-non-root-containers-index.html).

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html).

## Get this image

The Bitnami AlertManager Docker image is only available to [Bitnami Secure Images](https://bitnami.com) customers.

## Persisting your application

If you remove the container all your data and configurations will be lost, and the next time you run the image the database will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed.

For persistence you should mount a volume at the `/opt/bitnami/alertmanager/data` path. The above examples define a docker volume namely `alertmanager_data`. The Alertmanager application state will persist as long as this volume is not removed.

To avoid inadvertent removal of this volume you can [mount host directories as data volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/). Alternatively you can make use of volume plugins to host the volume data.

```console
docker run -v /path/to/alertmanager-persistence:/opt/bitnami/alertmanager/data bitnami/alertmanager:latest
```

> **NOTE** As this is a non-root container, the mounted files and directories must have the proper permissions for the UID `1001`.

## Connecting to other containers

Using [Docker container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/), a different server running inside a container can easily be accessed by your application containers and vice-versa.

Containers attached to the same network can communicate with each other using the container name as the hostname.

### Using the Command Line

#### Step 1: Create a network

```console
docker network create alertmanager-network --driver bridge
```

#### Step 2: Launch the Alertmanager container within your network

Use the `--network <NETWORK>` argument to the `docker run` command to attach the container to the `alertmanager-network` network.

```console
docker run --name alertmanager-node1 --network alertmanager-network bitnami/alertmanager:latest
```

#### Step 3: Run another containers

We can launch another containers using the same flag (`--network NETWORK`) in the `docker run` command. If you also set a name to your container, you will be able to use it as hostname in your network.

## Configuration

The configuration can easily be setup by mounting your own configuration file on the directory `/opt/bitnami/alertmanager/conf/`:

```console
docker run --name alertmanager -v /path/to/config.yml:/opt/bitnami/alertmanager/conf/config.yml bitnami/alertmanager:latest
```

After that, your configuration will be taken into account in the server's behaviour.

Using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  alertmanager:
    image: bitnami/alertmanager:latest
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config.yml:/opt/bitnami/alertmanager/conf/config.yml
```

Configuration is yaml based. The full documentation of the configuration can be found [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/).

### Amtool

`amtool` is a cli tool for interacting with the alertmanager api. It is bundled with all releases of alertmanager.

### FIPS configuration in Bitnami Secure Images

The Bitnami AlertManager Docker image from the [Bitnami Secure Images](https://go-vmware.broadcom.com/contact-us) catalog includes extra features and settings to configure the container with FIPS capabilities. You can configure the next environment variables:

- `OPENSSL_FIPS`: whether OpenSSL runs in FIPS mode or not. `yes` (default), `no`.
- `GODEBUG`: controls Go FIPS mode. Use `fips140=only` (restricted), `fips140=on` (relaxed), or `fips140=off` (disabled).

## Logging

The Bitnami alertmanager Docker image sends the container logs to the `stdout`. To view the logs:

```console
docker logs alertmanager
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

## Notable Changes

### Starting January 16, 2024

- The `docker-compose.yaml` file has been removed, as it was solely intended for internal testing purposes.
