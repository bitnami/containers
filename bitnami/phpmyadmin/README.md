## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [**minideb**](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) -a minimalist Debian based container image that gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution- or **scratch** -an explicitly empty image-.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Notation](https://notaryproject.dev/). [Check this post](https://blog.bitnami.com/2024/03/bitnami-packaged-containers-and-helm.html) to know how to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## How to deploy phpMyAdmin in Kubernetes?

Deploying Bitnami applications as Helm Charts is the easiest way to get started with our applications on Kubernetes. Read more about the installation in the [Bitnami phpMyAdmin Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/phpmyadmin).

Bitnami containers can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Catalog/services/tutorials/GUID-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html).

You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`.

## Prerequisites

To run this application you need [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine) >= `1.10.0`. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is recommended with a version `1.6.0` or later.

## How to use this image

phpMyAdmin requires access to a MySQL database or MariaDB database to work. We'll use our very own [MariaDB image](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/mariadb).

### Using the Docker Command Line

1. Create a network

    ```console
    docker network create phpmyadmin-tier
    ```

2. Create a volume for MariaDB persistence and create a MariaDB container

    ```console
    docker volume create --name mariadb_data
    docker run -d --name mariadb -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
      --net phpmyadmin-tier \
      --volume mariadb_data:/bitnami/mariadb \
      bitnami/mariadb:latest
    ```

3. Launch the phpMyAdmin container

    ```console
    docker run -d --name phpmyadmin -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
      --net phpmyadmin-tier \
      bitnami/phpmyadmin:latest
    ```

    Access your application at `http://your-ip/`

### Using Docker Compose

```console
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/containers/main/bitnami/phpmyadmin/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

Please be aware this file has not undergone internal testing. Consequently, we advise its use exclusively for development or testing purposes. For production-ready deployments, we highly recommend utilizing its associated [Bitnami Helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/phpmyadmin).

If you detect any issue in the `docker-compose.yaml` file, feel free to report it or contribute with a fix by following our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Persisting your application

If you remove the container all your data and configurations will be lost, and the next time you run the image the database will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed.

For persistence you should mount a volume at the `/bitnami` path. Additionally you should mount a volume for [persistence of the MariaDB data](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/mariadb#persisting-your-database).

The above examples define a Docker volume named `mariadb_data`. The application state will persist as long as this volume is not removed.

To avoid inadvertent removal of these volumes you can [mount host directories as data volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/). Alternatively you can make use of volume plugins to host the volume data.

#### Mount host directories as data volumes with Docker Compose

This requires a minor change to the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/phpmyadmin/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  mariadb:
  ...
    volumes:
      - /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami/mariadb
  ...
```

#### Mount host directories as data volumes using the Docker command line

1. Create a network (if it does not exist)

    ```console
    docker network create phpmyadmin-tier
    ```

2. Create a MariaDB container with host volume

    ```console
    docker run -d --name mariadb -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
      --net phpmyadmin-tier \
      --volume /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami/mariadb \
      bitnami/mariadb:latest
    ```

3. Launch the phpMyAdmin container

    ```console
    docker run -d --name phpmyadmin -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
      --net phpmyadmin-tier \
      bitnami/phpmyadmin:latest
    ```

## Upgrading phpMyAdmin

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of MariaDB and phpMyAdmin, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container. We will cover here the upgrade of the phpMyAdmin container. For the MariaDB upgrade see <https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/mariadb#upgrade-this-image>

The `bitnami/phpmyadmin:latest` tag always points to the most recent release. To get the most recent release you can simple repull the `latest` tag from the Docker Hub with `docker pull bitnami/phpmyadmin:latest`. However it is recommended to use [tagged versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/phpmyadmin/tags/).

1. Get the updated images:

    ```console
    docker pull bitnami/phpmyadmin:latest
    ```

2. Stop your container

    * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose stop phpmyadmin`
    * For manual execution: `$ docker stop phpmyadmin`

3. Remove the currently running container

    * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose rm -v phpmyadmin`
    * For manual execution: `$ docker rm -v phpmyadmin`

4. Run the new image

    * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose up phpmyadmin`
    * For manual execution: `docker run --name phpmyadmin bitnami/phpmyadmin:latest`

#### Specifying Environment variables using Docker Compose

This requires a change to the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/phpmyadmin/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  mariadb:
  ...
    environment:
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
  ...
  phpmyadmin:
  ...
    environment:
      - DATABASE_ALLOW_NO_PASSWORD=false
      - PHPMYADMIN_ALLOW_ARBITRARY_SERVER=yes
  ...
```

#### Specifying Environment variables on the Docker command line

```console
docker run -d --name phpmyadmin -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
  --net phpmyadmin-tier \
  --env PHPMYADMIN_PASSWORD=my_password \
  bitnami/phpmyadmin:latest
```

## Customize this image

The Bitnami phpMyAdmin Docker image is designed to be extended so it can be used as the base image for your custom web applications.

### Extend this image

Before extending this image, please note there are certain configuration settings you can modify using the original image:

* Settings that can be adapted using environment variables. For instance, you can change the ports used by Apache for HTTP and HTTPS, by setting the environment variables `APACHE_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER` and `APACHE_HTTPS_PORT_NUMBER` respectively.
* [Adding custom virtual hosts](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/apache#adding-custom-virtual-hosts).
* [Replacing the 'httpd.conf' file](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/apache#full-configuration).
* [Using custom SSL certificates](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/apache#using-custom-ssl-certificates).

If your desired customizations cannot be covered using the methods mentioned above, extend the image. To do so, create your own image using a Dockerfile with the format below:

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/phpmyadmin
### Put your customizations below
...
```

Here is an example of extending the image with the following modifications:

* Install the `vim` editor
* Modify the Apache configuration file
* Modify the ports used by Apache
* Modify the default container user

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/phpmyadmin

### Change user to perform privileged actions
USER 0
### Install 'vim'
RUN install_packages vim
### Revert to the original non-root user
USER 1001

### Enable mod_ratelimit module
RUN sed -i -r 's/#LoadModule ratelimit_module/LoadModule ratelimit_module/' /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf

### Modify the ports used by Apache by default
## It is also possible to change these environment variables at runtime
ENV APACHE_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER=8181
ENV APACHE_HTTPS_PORT_NUMBER=8143
EXPOSE 8181 8143

### Modify the default container user
USER 1002
```

Based on the extended image, you can use a Docker Compose file like the one below to add other features:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:10.11'
    environment:
      - MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=bitnami
    volumes:
      - 'mariadb_data:/bitnami/mariadb'
  phpmyadmin:
    build: .
    ports:
      - '80:8181'
      - '443:8143'
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
    volumes:
      - 'phpmyadmin_data:/bitnami/mariadb'
volumes:
  mariadb_data:
    driver: local
  phpmyadmin_data:
    driver: local
```

## Notable Changes

### 5.0.2-debian-10-r73

* Decrease the size of the container. The configuration logic is now based on Bash scripts in the `rootfs/` folder.
* The `PHPMYADMIN_ALLOW_NO_PASSWORD` environment variable has been deprecated in favor of `DATABASE_ALLOW_NO_PASSWORD`.
* New environment variables have been added to support configuring extra PHP options: `PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE` for `upload_max_filesize`, and `PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE` for `post_max_size`.

### 4.8.5-debian-9-r96 and 4.8.5-ol-7-r111

* This image has been adapted so it's easier to customize. See the [Customize this image](#customize-this-image) section for more information.
* The Apache configuration volume (`/bitnami/apache`) has been deprecated, and support for this feature will be dropped in the near future. Until then, the container will enable the Apache configuration from that volume if it exists. By default, and if the configuration volume does not exist, the configuration files will be regenerated each time the container is created. Users wanting to apply custom Apache configuration files are advised to mount a volume for the configuration at `/opt/bitnami/apache/conf`, or mount specific configuration files individually.
* The PHP configuration volume (`/bitnami/php`) has been deprecated, and support for this feature will be dropped in the near future. Until then, the container will enable the PHP configuration from that volume if it exists. By default, and if the configuration volume does not exist, the configuration files will be regenerated each time the container is created. Users wanting to apply custom PHP configuration files are advised to mount a volume for the configuration at `/opt/bitnami/php/conf`, or mount specific configuration files individually.
* Enabling custom Apache certificates by placing them at `/opt/bitnami/apache/certs` has been deprecated, and support for this functionality will be dropped in the near future. Users wanting to enable custom certificates are advised to mount their certificate files on top of the preconfigured ones at `/certs`.
