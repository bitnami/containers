docker run --name keycloak bitnami/keycloak:latest
```

**Warning**: This quick setup is only intended for development environments. You are encouraged to change the insecure default credentials and check out the available configuration options in the [Configuration](#configuration) section for a more secure deployment.

## ⚠️ Important Notice: Upcoming changes to the Bitnami Catalog

Beginning August 28th, 2025, Bitnami will evolve its public catalog to offer a curated set of hardened, security-focused images under the new [Bitnami Secure Images initiative](https://news.broadcom.com/app-dev/broadcom-introduces-bitnami-secure-images-for-production-ready-containerized-applications). As part of this transition:

- Granting community users access for the first time to security-optimized versions of popular container images.
- Bitnami will begin deprecating support for non-hardened, Debian-based software images in its free tier and will gradually remove non-latest tags from the public catalog. As a result, community users will have access to a reduced number of hardened images. These images are published only under the “latest” tag and are intended for development purposes
- Starting August 28th, over two weeks, all existing container images, including older or versioned tags (e.g., 2.50.0, 10.6), will be migrated from the public catalog (docker.io/bitnami) to the “Bitnami Legacy” repository (docker.io/bitnamilegacy), where they will no longer receive updates.
- For production workloads and long-term support, users are encouraged to adopt Bitnami Secure Images, which include hardened containers, smaller attack surfaces, CVE transparency (via VEX/KEV), SBOMs, and enterprise support.

These changes aim to improve the security posture of all Bitnami users by promoting best practices for software supply chain integrity and up-to-date deployments. For more details, visit the [Bitnami Secure Images announcement](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/issues/83267).

## Why use Bitnami Secure Images?

- Bitnami Secure Images and Helm charts are built to make open source more secure and enterprise ready.
- Triage security vulnerabilities faster, with transparency into CVE risks using industry standard Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange (VEX), KEV, and EPSS scores.
- Our hardened images use a minimal OS (Photon Linux), which reduces the attack surface while maintaining extensibility through the use of an industry standard package format.
- Stay more secure and compliant with continuously built images updated within hours of upstream patches.
- Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
- Hardened images come with attestation signatures (Notation), SBOMs, virus scan reports and other metadata produced in an SLSA-3 compliant software factory.

Only a subset of BSI applications are available for free. Looking to access the entire catalog of applications as well as enterprise support? Try the [commercial edition of Bitnami Secure Images today](https://www.arrow.com/globalecs/uk/products/bitnami-secure-images/).

## How to deploy Keycloak in Kubernetes?

Deploying Bitnami applications as Helm Charts is the easiest way to get started with our applications on Kubernetes. Read more about the installation in the [Bitnami Keycloak Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/keycloak).

## Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-work-with-non-root-containers-index.html).

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html).

You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`.

Subscribe to project updates by watching the [bitnami/containers GitHub repo](https://github.com/bitnami/containers).

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami keycloak Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/keycloak).

```console
docker pull bitnami/keycloak:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/keycloak/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
docker pull bitnami/keycloak:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command. Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION` and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` path placeholders in the example command below with the correct values.

```console
git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
docker build -t bitnami/APP:latest .
```

### Extra arguments to Keycloak startup

In case you want to add extra flags to the Keycloak use the `KEYCLOAK_EXTRA_ARGS` variable. Example:

```console
docker run --name keycloak \
  -e KEYCLOAK_EXTRA_ARGS="-Dkeycloak.profile.feature.scripts=enabled" \
  bitnami/keycloak:latest
```

Or, if you need flags which are applied directly to keycloak executable, you can use `KEYCLOAK_EXTRA_ARGS_PREPENDED` variable. Example:

```console
docker run --name keycloak \
  -e KEYCLOAK_EXTRA_ARGS_PREPENDED="--spi-login-protocol-openid-connect-legacy-logout-redirect-uri=true" \
  bitnami/keycloak:latest
```

### Initializing a new instance

When the container is launched, it will execute the files with extension `.sh` located at `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`.

In order to have your custom files inside the docker image you can mount them as a volume.

```console
docker run --name keycloak \
  -v /path/to/init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d \
  bitnami/keycloak:latest
```

Or with docker-compose

```yaml
keycloak:
  image: bitnami/keycloak:latest
  volumes:
    - /path/to/init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
```

### TLS Encryption

The Bitnami Keycloak Docker image allows configuring HTTPS/TLS encription. This is done by mounting in `/opt/bitnami/keycloak/certs` two files:

- `keystore`: File with the server keystore
- `truststore`: File with the server truststore

> Note: find more information about how to create these files at the [Keycloak documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/server/keycloak-truststore).

Apart from that, the following environment variables must be set:

- `KEYCLOAK_ENABLE_HTTPS`: Enable TLS encryption using the keystore. Default: **false**.
- `KEYCLOAK_HTTPS_KEY_STORE_FILE`: Path to the keystore file (e.g. `/opt/bitnami/keycloak/certs/keystore.jks`). No defaults.
- `KEYCLOAK_HTTPS_TRUST_STORE_FILE`: Path to the truststore file (e.g. `/opt/bitnami/keycloak/certs/truststore.jks`). No defaults.
- `KEYCLOAK_HTTPS_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD`: Password for accessing the keystore. No defaults.
- `KEYCLOAK_HTTPS_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD`: Password for accessing the truststore. No defaults.
- `KEYCLOAK_HTTPS_USE_PEM`: Set to true to configure HTTPS using PEM certificates'. Default: **false**.
- `KEYCLOAK_HTTPS_CERTIFICATE_FILE`: Path to the PEM certificate file (e.g. `/opt/bitnami/keycloak/certs/tls.crt`). No defaults.
- `KEYCLOAK_HTTPS_CERTIFICATE_KEY_FILE`: Path to the PEM key file (e.g. `/opt/bitnami/keycloak/certs/tls.key`). No defaults.

### Adding custom themes

In order to add new themes to Keycloak, you can mount them to the `/opt/bitnami/keycloak/themes` folder. The example below mounts a new theme.

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  postgresql:
    image: docker.io/bitnami/postgresql:latest
    environment:
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
      - POSTGRESQL_USERNAME=bn_keycloak
      - POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=bitnami_keycloak
    volumes:
      - postgresql_data:/bitnami/postgresql
  keycloak:
    image: docker.io/bitnami/keycloak:latest
    ports:
      - 80:8080
    environment:
      - KEYCLOAK_CREATE_ADMIN_USER=true
    depends_on:
      - postgresql
    volumes:
      - ./mynewtheme:/opt/bitnami/keycloak/themes/mynewtheme
volumes:
  postgresql_data:
    driver: local
```

### Enabling metrics

The Bitnami Keycloak container can activate different set of metrics (database, jgroups and http) by setting the environment variable `KC_METRICS_ENABLED=true`. See [the official documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/observability/configuration-metrics) for more information about these metrics.

### Enabling health endpoints

The Bitnami Keycloak container can activate several endpoints providing information about the health of Keycloak, by setting the environment variable `KC_HEALTH_ENABLED=true`.
See [the official documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/observability/health) for more information about these endpoints.

### Full configuration

The image looks for configuration files in the `/bitnami/keycloak/conf/` directory, this directory can be changed by setting the `KEYCLOAK_MOUNTED_CONF_DIR` environment variable.

```console
docker run --name keycloak \
    -v /path/to/keycloak.conf:/bitnami/keycloak/conf/keycloak.conf \
    bitnami/keycloak:latest
```

Or with docker-compose

```yaml
keycloak:
  image: bitnami/keycloak:latest
  volumes:
    - /path/to/keycloak.conf:/bitnami/keycloak/conf/keycloak.conf:ro
```

After that, your changes will be taken into account in the server's behaviour.

## Notable Changes

### 26.3.2-debian-12-r1

The following environment variables have been deprecated. Instead rely on the native `KC_*` equivalent environment variables:

- `KEYCLOAK_CACHE_TYPE`, `KEYCLOAK_CACHE_STACK` and `KEYCLOAK_CACHE_CONFIG_FILE`
- `KEYCLOAK_ENABLE_STATISTICS` and `KEYCLOAK_ENABLE_HEALTH_ENDPOINTS`
- `KEYCLOAK_LOG_LEVEL` and `KEYCLOAK_LOG_OUTPUT`
- `KEYCLOAK_HOSTNAME`, `KEYCLOAK_HOSTNAME_ADMIN` and `KEYCLOAK_HOSTNAME_STRICT`
- `KEYCLOAK_PROXY_HEADERS`
- `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USER` and `KEYCLOAK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`

The [https://github.com/aerogear/keycloak-metrics-spi](https://github.com/aerogear/keycloak-metrics-spi) provider is no longer shipped by default in the container image.
Also, support for deprecated SPI truststore was removed.

### 19-debian-11-r4

- TLS environment variables have been renamed to match upstream.
  - `KEYCLOAK_ENABLE_TLS` was renamed as `KEYCLOAK_ENABLE_HTTPS`.
  - `KEYCLOAK_TLS_KEYSTORE_FILE` was renamed as `KEYCLOAK_TLS_KEY_STORE_FILE`.
  - `KEYCLOAK_TLS_TRUSTSTORE_FILE` was renamed as `KEYCLOAK_TLS_TRUST_STORE_FILE`.
  - `KEYCLOAK_TLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` was renamed as `KEYCLOAK_TLS_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD`.
  - `KEYCLOAK_TLS_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD` was renamed as `KEYCLOAK_TLS_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD`.
- HTTPS/TLS can now be configured using PEM certificates.
- Added support to add SPI truststore file.

### 17-debian-10

Keycloak 17 is powered by Quarkus and to deploy it in production mode it is necessary to set up TLS.
To do this you need to set `KEYCLOAK_PRODUCTION` to **true** and configure TLS
