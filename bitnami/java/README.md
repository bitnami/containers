## What is Java?

> Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [**minideb**](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) -a minimalist Debian based container image that gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution- or **scratch** -an explicitly empty image-.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Notation](https://notaryproject.dev/). [Check this post](https://blog.bitnami.com/2024/03/bitnami-packaged-containers-and-helm.html) to know how to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## Only latest stable branch maintained in the free Bitnami catalog

Starting December 10th 2024, only the latest stable branch of any container will receive updates in the free Bitnami catalog. To access up-to-date releases for all upstream-supported branches, consider upgrading to Bitnami Premium. Previous versions already released will not be deleted. They are still available to pull from DockerHub.

Please check the Bitnami Premium page in our partner [Arrow Electronics](https://www.arrow.com/globalecs/na/vendors/bitnami?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=containers) for more information.

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html).

You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`.

Subscribe to project updates by watching the [bitnami/containers GitHub repo](https://github.com/bitnami/containers).

### Deprecation Note (2022-01-21)

The `prod` tags has been removed; from now on just the regular container images will be released.

### Deprecation Note (2020-08-18)

The formatting convention for `prod` tags has been changed:

* `BRANCH-debian-10-prod` is now tagged as `BRANCH-prod-debian-10`
* `VERSION-debian-10-rX-prod` is now tagged as `VERSION-prod-debian-10-rX`
* `latest-prod` is now deprecated

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Java Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/java).

```console
docker pull bitnami/java:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/java/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
docker pull bitnami/java:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command. Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION` and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` path placeholders in the example command below with the correct values.

```console
git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
docker build -t bitnami/APP:latest .
```

## Configuration

### Running your Java jar or war

The default work directory for the Java image is `/app`. You can mount a folder from your host here that includes your Java jar or war, and run it normally using the `java` command.

```console
docker run -it --name java -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/java:latest \
  java -jar package.jar
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
java:
  image: bitnami/java:latest
  command: "java -jar package.jar"
  volumes:
    - .:/app
```

## Replace the default truststore using a custom base image

In case you are replacing the default [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) base image with a custom base image (based on Debian), it is possible to replace the default truststore located in the `/opt/bitnami/java/lib/security` folder. This is done by setting the `JAVA_EXTRA_SECURITY_DIR` docker build ARG variable, which needs to point to a location that contains a *cacerts* file that would substitute the originally bundled truststore. In the following example we will use a minideb fork that contains a custom *cacerts* file in the */bitnami/java/extra-security* folder:

* In the Dockerfile, replace `FROM docker.io/bitnami/minideb:latest` to use a custom image, defined with the `MYJAVAFORK:TAG` placeholder:

```diff
- FROM bitnami/minideb:latest
+ FROM MYFORK:TAG
```

* Run `docker build` setting the value of `JAVA_EXTRA_SECURITY_DIR`. Remember to replace the `MYJAVAFORK:TAG` placeholder.

```console
docker build --build-arg JAVA_EXTRA_SECURITY_DIR=/bitnami/java/extra-security -t MYJAVAFORK:TAG .
```

## Maintenance

### Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of Java, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

#### Step 1: Get the updated image

```console
docker pull bitnami/java:latest
```

or if you're using Docker Compose, update the value of the image property to `bitnami/java:latest`.

#### Step 2: Remove the currently running container

```console
docker rm -v java
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
docker-compose rm -v java
```

#### Step 3: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image.

```console
docker run --name java bitnami/java:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
docker-compose up java
```

## Notable Changes

### 1.8.252-debian-10-r0, 11.0.7-debian-10-r7, and 15.0.1-debian-10-r20

* Java distribution has been migrated from AdoptOpenJDK to OpenJDK Liberica. As part of VMware, we have an agreement with Bell Software to distribute the Liberica distribution of OpenJDK. That way, we can provide support & the latest versions and security releases for Java.
