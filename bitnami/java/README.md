## ⚠️ Important Notice: Upcoming changes to the Bitnami Catalog

Beginning August 28th, 2025, Bitnami will evolve its public catalog to offer a curated set of hardened, security-focused images under the new [Bitnami Secure Images initiative](https://news.broadcom.com/app-dev/broadcom-introduces-bitnami-secure-images-for-production-ready-containerized-applications). As part of this transition:

- Granting community users access for the first time to security-optimized versions of popular container images.
- Bitnami will begin deprecating support for non-hardened, Debian-based software images in its free tier and will gradually remove non-latest tags from the public catalog. As a result, community users will have access to a reduced number of hardened images. These images are published only under the “latest” tag and are intended for development purposes
- Starting August 28th, over two weeks, all existing container images, including older or versioned tags (e.g., 2.50.0, 10.6), will be migrated from the public catalog (docker.io/bitnami) to the “Bitnami Legacy” repository (docker.io/bitnamilegacy), where they will no longer receive updates.
- For production workloads and long-term support, users are encouraged to adopt Bitnami Secure Images, which include hardened containers, smaller attack surfaces, CVE transparency (via VEX/KEV), SBOMs, and enterprise support.

These changes aim to improve the security posture of all Bitnami users by promoting best practices for software supply chain integrity and up-to-date deployments. For more details, visit the [Bitnami Secure Images announcement](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/issues/83267).

## Why use Bitnami Secure Images?

- Bitnami Secure Images and Helm charts are built to make open source more secure and enterprise ready.
- Triage security vulnerabilities faster, with transparency into CVE risks using industry standard Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange (VEX), KEV, and EPSS scores.
- Our hardened images use a minimal OS (Photon Linux), which reduces the attack surface while maintaining extensibility through the use of an industry standard package format.
- Stay more secure and compliant with continuously built images updated within hours of upstream patches.
- Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
- Hardened images come with attestation signatures (Notation), SBOMs, virus scan reports and other metadata produced in an SLSA-3 compliant software factory.

Only a subset of BSI applications are available for free. Looking to access the entire catalog of applications as well as enterprise support? Try the [commercial edition of Bitnami Secure Images today](https://www.arrow.com/globalecs/uk/products/bitnami-secure-images/).

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html).

You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`.

Subscribe to project updates by watching the [bitnami/containers GitHub repo](https://github.com/bitnami/containers).

### Deprecation Note (2022-01-21)

The `prod` tags has been removed; from now on just the regular container images will be released.

### Deprecation Note (2020-08-18)

The formatting convention for `prod` tags has been changed:

- `BRANCH-debian-10-prod` is now tagged as `BRANCH-prod-debian-10`
- `VERSION-debian-10-rX-prod` is now tagged as `VERSION-prod-debian-10-rX`
- `latest-prod` is now deprecated

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Java Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/java).

```console
docker pull bitnami/java:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/java/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
docker pull bitnami/java:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command. Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION` and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` path placeholders in the example command below with the correct values.

```console
git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
docker build -t bitnami/APP:latest .
```

## Configuration

### Running your Java jar or war

The default work directory for the Java image is `/app`. You can mount a folder from your host here that includes your Java jar or war, and run it normally using the `java` command.

```console
docker run -it --name java -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/java:latest \
  java -jar package.jar
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
java:
  image: bitnami/java:latest
  command: "java -jar package.jar"
  volumes:
    - .:/app
```

## Replace the default truststore using a custom base image

In case you are replacing the default [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) base image with a custom base image (based on Debian), it is possible to replace the default truststore located in the `/opt/bitnami/java/lib/security` folder. This is done by setting the `JAVA_EXTRA_SECURITY_DIR` docker build ARG variable, which needs to point to a location that contains a *cacerts* file that would substitute the originally bundled truststore. In the following example we will use a minideb fork that contains a custom *cacerts* file in the */bitnami/java/extra-security* folder:

- In the Dockerfile, replace `FROM docker.io/bitnami/minideb:latest` to use a custom image, defined with the `MYJAVAFORK:TAG` placeholder:

```diff
- FROM bitnami/minideb:latest
+ FROM MYFORK:TAG
```

- Run `docker build` setting the value of `JAVA_EXTRA_SECURITY_DIR`. Remember to replace the `MYJAVAFORK:TAG` placeholder.

```console
docker build --build-arg JAVA_EXTRA_SECURITY_DIR=/bitnami/java/extra-security -t MYJAVAFORK:TAG .
```

### FIPS configuration in Bitnami Secure Images

The Bitnami Java Docker image from the [Bitnami Secure Images](https://www.arrow.com/globalecs/uk/products/bitnami-secure-images/) catalog includes extra features and settings to configure the container with FIPS capabilities. You can configure the next environment variables:

- `OPENSSL_FIPS`: whether OpenSSL runs in FIPS mode or not. `yes` (default), `no`.

## Maintenance

### Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of Java, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

#### Step 1: Get the updated image

```console
docker pull bitnami/java:latest
```

or if you're using Docker Compose, update the value of the image property to `bitnami/java:latest`.

#### Step 2: Remove the currently running container

```console
docker rm -v java
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
docker-compose rm -v java
```

#### Step 3: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image.

```console
docker run --name java bitnami/java:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
docker-compose up java
```

## Notable Changes

### 1.8.252-debian-10-r0, 11.0.7-debian-10-r7, and 15.0.1-debian-10-r20

- Java distribution has been migrated from AdoptOpenJDK to OpenJDK Liberica. As part of VMware, we have an agreement with Bell Software to distribute the Liberica distribution of OpenJDK. That way, we can provide support & the latest versions and security releases for Java.
