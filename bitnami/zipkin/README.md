## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [**minideb**](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) -a minimalist Debian based container image that gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution- or **scratch** -an explicitly empty image-.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Notation](https://notaryproject.dev/). [Check this post](https://blog.bitnami.com/2024/03/bitnami-packaged-containers-and-helm.html) to know how to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Catalog/services/tutorials/GUID-work-with-non-root-containers-index.html).

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Catalog/services/tutorials/GUID-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html).

You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`.

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami zipkin Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/zipkin).

```console
docker pull bitnami/zipkin:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/zipkin/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
docker pull bitnami/zipkin:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command. Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION` and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` path placeholders in the example command below with the correct values.

```console
git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
docker build -t bitnami/APP:latest .
```

## Entering the REPL

By default, running this image will drop you into the Python REPL, where you can interactively test and try things out with Zipkin in Python.

```console
docker run -it --name zipkin bitnami/zipkin
```

## Configuration

### Running commands

To run commands inside this container you can use `docker run`, for example to execute `start-zipkin --version` you can follow below example
