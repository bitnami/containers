## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [**minideb**](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) -a minimalist Debian based container image that gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution- or **scratch** -an explicitly empty image-.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Notation](https://notaryproject.dev/). [Check this post](https://blog.bitnami.com/2024/03/bitnami-packaged-containers-and-helm.html) to know how to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-work-with-non-root-containers-index.html).

## Only latest stable branch maintained in the free Bitnami catalog

Starting December 10th 2024, only the latest stable branch of any container will receive updates in the free Bitnami catalog. To access up-to-date releases for all upstream-supported branches, consider upgrading to Bitnami Premium. Previous versions already released will not be deleted. They are still available to pull from DockerHub.

Please check the Bitnami Premium page in our partner [Arrow Electronics](https://www.arrow.com/globalecs/na/vendors/bitnami?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=containers) for more information.

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html).

You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`.

Subscribe to project updates by watching the [bitnami/containers GitHub repo](https://github.com/bitnami/containers).

## Prerequisites

To run this application you need [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine) >= `1.10.0`. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is recommended with a version `1.6.0` or later.

## How to get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Matomo Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/matomo/).
To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. Find the [list of available versions] (<https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/matomo/tags/>) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
docker pull bitnami/matomo:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command. Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION` and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` path placeholders in the example command below with the correct values.

```console
git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
docker build -t bitnami/APP:latest .
```

## How to use this image

Matomo requires access to a MySQL database or MariaDB database to store information. It uses our [MariaDB image] (<https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/mariadb>) for the database requirements.

### Run the application using the Docker Command Line

If you want to run the application manually instead of using docker-compose, these are the basic steps you need to run:

1. Create a new network for the application and the database:

    ```console
    docker network create matomo_network
    ```

2. Create a volume for MariaDB persistence and create a MariaDB container

    ```console
    docker volume create --name mariadb_data
    docker run -d --name mariadb \
      -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
      -e MARIADB_USER=bn_matomo \
      -e MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_matomo \
      --net matomo_network \
      --volume mariadb_data:/bitnami \
      bitnami/mariadb:latest
    ```

3. Create volumes for Matomo persistence and launch the container

    ```console
    docker volume create --name matomo_data
    docker run -d --name matomo -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
      -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
      -e MATOMO_DATABASE_USER=bn_matomo \
      -e MATOMO_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_matomo \
      --net matomo_network \
      --volume matomo_data:/bitnami \
      bitnami/matomo:latest
    ```

  Then you can access your application at `http://your-ip/`

### Run the application using Docker Compose

```console
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/containers/main/bitnami/matomo/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

Please be aware this file has not undergone internal testing. Consequently, we advise its use exclusively for development or testing purposes. For production-ready deployments, we highly recommend utilizing its associated [Bitnami Helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/matomo).

If you detect any issue in the `docker-compose.yaml` file, feel free to report it or contribute with a fix by following our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Persisting your application

If you remove the container all your data and configurations will be lost, and the next time you run the image the database will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed.

For persistence you should mount a volume at the `/bitnami` path. Additionally you should mount a volume for [persistence of the MariaDB data](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/mariadb#persisting-your-database).

The above examples define docker volumes namely `mariadb_data` and `matomo_data`. The Matomo application state will persist as long as these volumes are not removed.

To avoid inadvertent removal of these volumes you can [mount host directories as data volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/). Alternatively you can make use of volume plugins to host the volume data.

#### Mount host directories as data volumes with Docker Compose

This requires a minor change to the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/matomo/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  mariadb:
  ...
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami'
  ...
  matomo:
  ...
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/matomo-persistence:/bitnami'
  ...
```

> NOTE: As this is a non-root container, the mounted files and directories must have the proper permissions for the UID `1001`.

#### Mount host directories as data volumes using the Docker command line

In this case you need to specify the directories to mount on the run command. The process is the same than the one previously shown:

1. Create a network (if it does not exist):

    ```console
    docker network create matomo_network
    ```

2. Create a MariaDB container with host volume:

   ```console
    docker run -d --name mariadb
     -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
     -e MARIADB_USER=bn_matomo \
     -e MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_matomo \
     --net matomo_network \
     --volume /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami \
     bitnami/mariadb:latest
   ```

    *Note:* You need to give the container a name in order to Matomo to resolve the host

3. Create the Matomo container with host volumes:

    ```console
    docker run -d --name matomo -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
      -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
      -e MATOMO_DATABASE_USER=bn_matomo \
      -e MATOMO_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_matomo \
      --net matomo_network \
      --volume /path/to/matomo-persistence:/bitnami \
      bitnami/matomo:latest
    ```

### Backing up your container

To backup your data, configuration and logs, follow these simple steps:

#### Step 1: Stop the currently running container

```console
docker stop matomo
```

Or using Docker Compose:

```console
docker-compose stop matomo
```

#### Step 2: Run the backup command

We need to mount two volumes in a container we will use to create the backup: a directory on your host to store the backup in, and the volumes from the container we just stopped so we can access the data.

```console
docker run --rm -v /path/to/matomo-backups:/backups --volumes-from matomo busybox \
  cp -a /bitnami/matomo /backups/latest
```

### Restoring a backup

Restoring a backup is as simple as mounting the backup as volumes in the containers.

For the MariaDB database container:

```diff
 $ docker run -d --name mariadb \
   ...
-  --volume /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami/mariadb \
+  --volume /path/to/mariadb-backups/latest:/bitnami/mariadb \
   bitnami/mariadb:latest
```

For the Matomo container:

```diff
 $ docker run -d --name matomo \
   ...
-  --volume /path/to/matomo-persistence:/bitnami/matomo \
+  --volume /path/to/matomo-backups/latest:/bitnami/matomo \
   bitnami/matomo:latest
```

## Upgrading Matomo

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of MariaDB and Matomo, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container. We will cover here the upgrade of the Matomo container. For the MariaDB upgrade you can take a look at <https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/mariadb#upgrade-this-image>

1. Get the updated images:

    ```console
    docker pull bitnami/matomo:latest
    ```

2. Stop your container

    * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose stop matomo`
    * For manual execution: `$ docker stop matomo`

3. Take a snapshot of the application state

    ```console
    rsync -a /path/to/matomo-persistence /path/to/matomo-persistence.bkp.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H.%M.%S)
    ```

    Additionally, [snapshot the MariaDB data](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/mariadb#step-2-stop-and-backup-the-currently-running-container)

    You can use these snapshots to restore the application state should the upgrade fail.

4. Remove the currently running container

    * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose rm -v matomo`
    * For manual execution: `$ docker rm -v matomo`

5. Run the new image

    * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose up matomo`
    * For manual execution (mount the directories if needed): `docker run --name matomo bitnami/matomo:latest`

When you start the Matomo image, you can adjust the configuration of the instance by passing one or more environment variables either on the docker-compose file or on the `docker run` command line.

If you want to add a new environment variable:

* For docker-compose add the variable name and value under the application section in the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/matomo/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
application:
  ...
  environment:
    - MATOMO_PASSWORD=my_password
  ...
```

* For manual execution add a `-e` option with each variable and value:

```console
 docker run -d -e MATOMO_PASSWORD=my_password -p 80:80 --name matomo -v /your/local/path/bitnami/matomo:/bitnami --net=matomo_network bitnami/matomo
```

#### Reverse proxy configuration example

This would be an example of reverse proxy configuration:

* Modify the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/matomo/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
  application:
  ...
    environment:
      - MATOMO_PROXY_CLIENT_HEADER=HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR
      - MATOMO_ENABLE_FORCE_SSL=yes
      - MATOMO_ENABLE_ASSUME_SECURE_PROTOCOL=yes
  ...
```

* For manual execution:

```console
 $ docker run -d --name matomo -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
   --net matomo_network \
   -e MARIADB_HOST=mariadb \
   -e MARIADB_PORT_NUMBER=3306 \
   -e MATOMO_DATABASE_USER=bn_matomo \
   -e MATOMO_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_matomo \
   -e MATOMO_PROXY_CLIENT_HEADER=HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR \
   -e MATOMO_ENABLE_FORCE_SSL=yes \
   -e MATOMO_ENABLE_ASSUME_SECURE_PROTOCOL=yes \
   -v /your/local/path/bitnami/matomo:/bitnami \
 bitnami/matomo:latest
```

#### SMTP example

This would be an example of SMTP configuration using a Gmail account:

* Modify the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/matomo/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
  matomo:
    ...
    environment:
      - MATOMO_DATABASE_USER=bn_matomo
      - MATOMO_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_matomo
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
      - MATOMO_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
      - MATOMO_SMTP_PORT=587
      - MATOMO_SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
      - MATOMO_SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password
  ...
```

* For manual execution:

```console
 docker run -d --name matomo -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
    --env MATOMO_DATABASE_USER=bn_matomo \
    --env MATOMO_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_matomo \
    --env MATOMO_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com \
    --env MATOMO_SMTP_PORT=587 \
    --env MATOMO_SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com \
    --env MATOMO_SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password \
    --network matomo-tier \
    --volume /path/to/matomo-persistence:/bitnami \
    bitnami/matomo:latest
```

## Customize this image

The Bitnami Matomo Docker image is designed to be extended so it can be used as the base image for your custom web applications.

### Extend this image

Before extending this image, please note there are certain configuration settings you can modify using the original image:

* Settings that can be adapted using environment variables. For instance, you can change the ports used by Apache for HTTP and HTTPS, by setting the environment variables `APACHE_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER` and `APACHE_HTTPS_PORT_NUMBER` respectively.
* [Adding custom virtual hosts](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/apache#adding-custom-virtual-hosts).
* [Replacing the 'httpd.conf' file](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/apache#full-configuration).
* [Using custom SSL certificates](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/apache#using-custom-ssl-certificates).

If your desired customizations cannot be covered using the methods mentioned above, extend the image. To do so, create your own image using a Dockerfile with the format below:

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/matomo
### Put your customizations below
...
```

Here is an example of extending the image with the following modifications:

* Install the `vim` editor
* Modify the Apache configuration file
* Modify the ports used by Apache

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/matomo

### Change user to perform privileged actions
USER 0

### Install 'vim'
RUN install_packages vim

### Enable mod_ratelimit module
RUN sed -i -r 's/#LoadModule ratelimit_module/LoadModule ratelimit_module/' /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf

### Revert to the original non-root user
USER 1001

### Modify the ports used by Apache by default
## It is also possible to change these environment variables at runtime
ENV APACHE_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER=8181
ENV APACHE_HTTPS_PORT_NUMBER=8143
EXPOSE 8181 8143
```

Based on the extended image, you can use a Docker Compose file like the one below to add other features:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:10.11'
    environment:
      - MARIADB_USER=bn_matomo
      - MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_matomo
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
    volumes:
      - 'mariadb_data:/bitnami'
  matomo:
    build: .
    environment:
      - MARIADB_HOST=mariadb
      - MARIADB_PORT_NUMBER=3306
      - MATOMO_DATABASE_USER=bn_matomo
      - MATOMO_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_matomo
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
    ports:
      - '80:8181'
      - '443:8143'
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
    volumes:
      - 'matomo_data:/bitnami'
volumes:
  mariadb_data:
    driver: local
  matomo_data:
    driver: local
```

## Notable Changes

## 4.15.0-debian-11-r20

From this version on, all Matomo files are persisted (MATOMO_DATA_TO_PERSIST env var). During the upgrade process, they will be replaced (except the config.ini.php file) as suggested in [the official documentation](https://matomo.org/faq/on-premise/update-matomo/#the-manual-three-step-update)

### 3.14.1-debian-10-r82

* The size of the container image has been decreased.
* The configuration logic is now based on Bash scripts in the *rootfs/* folder.
* The Matomo container image has been migrated to a "non-root" user approach. Previously the container ran as the `root` user and the Apache daemon was started as the `daemon` user. From now on, both the container and the Apache daemon run as user `1001`. You can revert this behavior by changing `USER 1001` to `USER root` in the Dockerfile, or `user: root` in `docker-compose.yml`. Consequences:
  * The HTTP/HTTPS ports exposed by the container are now `8080/8443` instead of `80/443`.
  * Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed when data is persisted using docker or docker-compose. We highly recommend migrating the Matomo site by exporting its content, and importing it on a new Matomo container. Follow the steps in [Backing up your container](#backing-up-your-container) and [Restoring a backup](#restoring-a-backup) to migrate the data between the old and new container.

To upgrade a previous Bitnami Matomo container image, which did not support non-root, the easiest way is to start the new image as a root user and updating the port numbers. Modify your docker-compose.yml file as follows:

```diff
       - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
+    user: root
     ports:
-      - '80:80'
-      - '443:443'
+      - '80:8080'
+      - '443:8443'
     volumes:
```

### 3.9.1-debian-9-r51 and 3.9.1-ol-7-r62

* This image has been adapted so it's easier to customize. See the [Customize this image](#customize-this-image) section for more information.
* The Apache configuration volume (`/bitnami/apache`) has been deprecated, and support for this feature will be dropped in the near future. Until then, the container will enable the Apache configuration from that volume if it exists. By default, and if the configuration volume does not exist, the configuration files will be regenerated each time the container is created. Users wanting to apply custom Apache configuration files are advised to mount a volume for the configuration at `/opt/bitnami/apache/conf`, or mount specific configuration files individually.
* The PHP configuration volume (`/bitnami/php`) has been deprecated, and support for this feature will be dropped in the near future. Until then, the container will enable the PHP configuration from that volume if it exists. By default, and if the configuration volume does not exist, the configuration files will be regenerated each time the container is created. Users wanting to apply custom PHP configuration files are advised to mount a volume for the configuration at `/opt/bitnami/php/conf`, or mount specific configuration files individually.
* Enabling custom Apache certificates by placing them at `/opt/bitnami/apache/certs` has been deprecated, and support for this functionality will be dropped in the near future. Users wanting to enable custom certificates are advised to mount their certificate files on top of the preconfigured ones at `/certs`.
