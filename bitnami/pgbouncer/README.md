## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [**minideb**](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) -a minimalist Debian based container image that gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution- or **scratch** -an explicitly empty image-.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Notation](https://notaryproject.dev/). [Check this post](https://blog.bitnami.com/2024/03/bitnami-packaged-containers-and-helm.html) to know how to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Catalog/services/tutorials/GUID-work-with-non-root-containers-index.html).

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Catalog/services/tutorials/GUID-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html).

You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`.

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami pgbouncer Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/pgbouncer).

```console
docker pull bitnami/pgbouncer:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/pgbouncer/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
docker pull bitnami/pgbouncer:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command. Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION` and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` path placeholders in the example command below with the correct values.

```console
git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
docker build -t bitnami/APP:latest .
```

### Daemon settings

The following parameters can be set for the PgBouncer daemon:

### Authentication

The authentication mode can be set using the `PGBOUNCER_AUTH_TYPE` variable, which can be set to any of the values available [in the official PgBouncer documentation](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html). In the case of the `scram-sha-256` authentication type (default value), set the backend PostgreSQL credentials as using the variables described in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) table.

### Extra arguments to PgBouncer startup

In case you want to add extra flags to the PgBouncer command, use the `PGBOUNCER_EXTRA_FLAGS` variable. Example:

```console
docker run --name pgbouncer \
  -e PGBOUNCER_EXTRA_FLAGS="--verbose" \
  bitnami/pgbouncer:latest
```

### Exposed database

* `PGBOUNCER_DATABASE`: PgBouncer exposed database. Default: **postgres**.

In case you'd like pgbouncer to expose your database with a different name, you can use the `PGBOUNCER_DATABASE` variable.
To expose the same database name as the backend, set `PGBOUNCER_DATABASE="$POSTGRESQL_DATABASE"`.
To expose a ["fallback database" (wildcard that matches any)](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html#section-databases)), set `PGBOUNCER_DATABASE="*"`.

### Initializing a new instance

When the container is launched, it will execute the files with extension `.sh` located at `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`.

In order to have your custom files inside the docker image you can mount them as a volume.

```console
docker run --name pgbouncer \
  -v /path/to/init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d \
  bitnami/pgbouncer:latest
```

Or with docker-compose

```yaml
pgbouncer:
  image: bitnami/pgbouncer:latest
  volumes:
    - /path/to/init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
```

### Securing PgBouncer traffic

PgBouncer supports the encryption of connections using the SSL/TLS protocol. Should you desire to enable this optional feature, you may use the following environment variables to configure the application:

* `PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_SSLMODE`: TLS traffic settings. Defaults to `disable`. Check the [official PgBouncer documentation](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html) for the available values for `client_tls_sslmode`.

When enabling TLS, PgBouncer will support both standard and encrypted traffic by default but prefer the latter. Below there are some examples of how to quickly set up client TLS traffic:

1. Using `docker run`

    ```console
    $ docker run \
        -v /path/to/certs:/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/certs \
        -e PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_SSLMODE=require \
        -e PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/certs/pgbouncer.crt \
        -e PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/certs/pgbouncer.key \
        bitnami/pgbouncer:latest
    ```

2. Modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file present in this repository:

    ```yaml
    services:
      pgbouncer:
      ...
        environment:
          ...
          - PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_SSLMODE=require
          - PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/certs/pgbouncer.crt
          - PGBOUNCER_CLIENT_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/certs/pgbouncer.key
        ...
        volumes:
          ...
          - /path/to/certs:/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/certs
      ...
    ```

Alternatively, you may also provide this configuration in your [custom](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/pgbouncer#configuration-file) configuration file.

### Configuration file

The image looks for `pgbouncer.ini` file in `/opt/bitnami/pgbouncer/conf/`. You can mount a volume at `/bitnami/pgbouncer/conf/` and copy/edit the `pgbouncer.ini` file in the `/path/to/pgbouncer-persistence/conf/`. The default configurations will be populated to the `conf/` directory if it's empty.

```console
/path/to/pgbouncer-persistence/conf/
└── pgbouncer.ini

0 directories, 1 file
```

As PgBouncer image is non-root, you need to set the proper permissions to the mounted directory in your host:

```console
sudo chown 1001:1001 /path/to/pgbouncer-persistence/conf/
```

#### Step 1: Run the PgBouncer image

Run the PgBouncer image, mounting a directory from your host.

```console
docker run --name pgbouncer \
    -v /path/to/pgbouncer-persistence/conf/:/bitnami/pgbouncer/conf/ \
    bitnami/pgbouncer:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

...

services:
  pgbouncer:
    image: 'bitnami/pgbouncer:latest'
    ports:
      - '6432:6432'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/pgbouncer-persistence/conf/:/bitnami/pgbouncer/conf/
```

#### Step 2: Edit the configuration

Edit the configuration on your host using your favorite editor.

```console
vi /path/to/pgbouncer-persistence/conf/pgbouncer.ini
```

#### Step 3: Restart PgBouncer

After changing the configuration, restart your PgBouncer container for changes to take effect.

```console
docker restart pgbouncer
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
docker-compose restart pgbouncer
```

Refer to the [server configuration](https://www.pgbouncer.org/usage.html) manual for the complete list of configuration options.

### How to connect with multiple PostgreSQL servers

It is possible to connect a single PgBouncer instance with multiple PostgreSQL backends. By using as many `PGBOUNCER_DSN_${i}` environment variables (with `i` starting at zero, `0`) as needed, and the `PGBOUNCER_USERLIST_FILE` variable pointing to a mounted volume with the required credentials for any extra PostgreSQL database in the format `"<postgresql-user>" "<password>"`.

The PgBouncer initialization process requires one PostgreSQL backend to be configured using the different `POSTGRESQL_*` variables listed in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section, but the rest of backends connections can be provided using the method explained in this section. An example `docker-compose.yaml` for this scenario can be found below

```yaml
  pg1:
    image: docker.io/bitnami/postgresql:14
    volumes:
      - 'pg1_data:/bitnami/postgresql'
    environment:
      - POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password1
      - POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=db1

  pg2:
    image: docker.io/bitnami/postgresql:15
    volumes:
      - 'pg2_data:/bitnami/postgresql'
    environment:
      - POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password2
      - POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=db2

  pg3:
    image: docker.io/bitnami/postgresql:14
    volumes:
      - 'pg3_data:/bitnami/postgresql'
    environment:
      - POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password3
      - POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=db3

  pgbouncer:
    image: docker.io/bitnami/pgbouncer:1
    ports:
      - 6432:6432
    volumes:
      - './userlists.txt:/bitnami/userlists.txt'
    environment:
      - POSTGRESQL_HOST=pg1
      - POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password1
      - POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=db1
      - PGBOUNCER_AUTH_TYPE=trust
      - PGBOUNCER_USERLIST_FILE=/bitnami/userlists.txt
      - PGBOUNCER_DSN_0=pg1=host=pg1 port=5432 dbname=db1
      - PGBOUNCER_DSN_1=pg2=host=pg2 port=5432 dbname=db2
      - PGBOUNCER_DSN_2=pg3=host=pg3 port=5432 dbname=db3
volumes:
  pg1_data:
    driver: local
  pg2_data:
    driver: local
  pg3_data:
    driver: local
```

And this is the content of the `userlists.txt` file:

```text
"postgres" "password1"
"postgres" "password2"
"postgres" "password3"
```

Once initialized, the scenario above provides access to three diferent PostgreSQL backends from a single PgBouncer instance. As an example, you can request the PostgreSQL version of the backend server number two (notice it is the only running PostgreSQL 15.x in this scenario):

```bash
$ docker exec -it -u root debian-12-pgbouncer-1 psql -p 6432 -U postgres pg2 -c "show server_version;"
 server_version
 ----------------
  15.4
  (1 row)
```
